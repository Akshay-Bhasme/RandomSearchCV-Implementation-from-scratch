# RandomSearchCV-Implementation-from-scratch
This repository provides an implementation of RandomSearchCV, which is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model. One of the main challenges in machine learning is building a well-fitted model that is neither underfit nor overfit. The hyperparameters of a machine learning model determine whether it will be overfit, underfit or well fit. Hyperparameters control the learning process of a machine learning model and need to be tuned to train a reliable model that gives high accuracy in predicting future query data points.

To understand the concept of underfitting and overfitting, consider an example using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Underfitting occurs when a model is biased towards the majority class, and overfitting occurs when a model tries to fit every point in the training data, even if it is an outlier. A well-fit model learns properly without overreacting to the presence of outliers and classifies the data points correctly.

To generalize a model, we need to select the optimal hyperparameters that work well on future, unseen data. Although we can split the data into training and test sets to train and test the model, there is no guarantee that it will give the same accuracy for classifying future data. To solve this problem, we can use cross-validation, which involves dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets. We use the validation set to select the best hyperparameters, and then we use the test set to evaluate the performance of the model.

K-Fold cross-validation is a commonly used technique where we divide the data into K-folds and use K-1 folds for training and 1 fold for validation. We repeat this process K times, using a different fold for validation each time. This approach allows us to use all of the data for both training and validation, and it helps to reduce the variance in the estimate of the model's performance.

Randomized search is a method of hyperparameter optimization that randomly samples the hyperparameter space to find the optimal hyperparameters. It is often more efficient than grid search because it does not require an exhaustive search over all possible hyperparameter combinations. In this repository, the RandomSearchCV is implemented from scratch with 3-fold cross-validation using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm as the classifier.
